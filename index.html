    <h3>In regard to Natasha Wachira:</h3>
    <p> I am a recent alumni of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LCMNairobi/">Loreto Convet Msongari</a> having graduated highschool in the year 2021.I have had a great interest in emerging technology. Following this interest, I decided to enroll in the Software Development class at Moringa School to further my passion for programming.</p>
    <p>The following is a list of the projects I have worked on during my prep course at <a href="http://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School.</a></p>

    <p>Apart from my interest in technology, my hobbies include martial arts particularly tae-kwon-do. I attained a blue belt in this field during my early teenage years.I intend to continue with this intrest as martial arts has taught me courtesy,integrity,persevearance,selfcontrol as well as  aided the building of my indominatable spirit.</p>
