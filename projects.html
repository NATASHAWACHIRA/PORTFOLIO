    <h1>MY PROJECTS:</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>I have worked on several projects during prep at Moringa School which involve the use of html. HTML (hypertext markup language) is a programming language that enables one to design documents to be displayed on a browser.</h3>
    <h3>Furthermore, the use of CSS is highly involved to make one's webpage more aesthetically pleasing. I have majorly made use of CSS to create the layout of my website as well as the design.</h3>
